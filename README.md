Have you ever wanted to see with eyes wide open?
  Have you ever wanted to see past the lies of The City?
  I did. And it changed me. To truly see how sick Marlowe was broke me.
  I am no longer a man but an idea. A sense of purpose. Will made manifest.
And you, Mary Jane, asked to save the city. The gifts I leave for you here are simply apart of our contract.
  Be the targe of the city, the one who stands on filthy streets with justice in her heart.
  I must tell you though: Marlowe will try to break you, to strip you of yourself, and turn you into another shambling husk among the streets.
Be strong. Be unchanged. Be the Hero this city yearns for.
